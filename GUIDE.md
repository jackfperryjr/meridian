# Meridian — Player Guide

Meridian is a DragonRealms game client for Windows, Mac, and Linux. It connects directly to the DragonRealms servers and gives you a clean, modern window for playing — with live vitals, room info, experience tracking, highlights, and optional Lich scripting support.

## Installation

1. Go to the [Releases page](../../releases) on GitHub.
2. Download the file for your operating system:
   - **Windows:** `Meridian-Setup-x.x.x.exe`
   - **Mac:** `Meridian-x.x.x.dmg`
   - **Linux:** `Meridian-x.x.x.AppImage`
3. Run the installer. On Windows, you may see a SmartScreen warning that says "Windows protected your PC." Click **More info**, then **Run anyway**. This happens because the app is not yet signed with a paid code-signing certificate — it is safe.
4. Meridian will open automatically after installation.

---

## Logging in for the first time

When you open Meridian for the first time, you will see the **Sign in** screen.

1. Enter your **Simutronics account name** (the username you use on the Simutronics website or in other clients like StormFront or Wizard).
2. Enter your **password**.
3. Click **Sign in**.

Meridian will connect to the Simutronics login servers. If you have access to multiple DragonRealms game instances (e.g. Prime, Platinum, The Fallen), you will be asked to **Choose server**. Select the one you want.

Next, you will see the **Choose character** screen. Click your character's name to enter the game.

Meridian saves your account name automatically so you don't have to type it every time.

---

## Logging in on future visits

After your first login, Meridian shows a **Welcome back** screen listing your saved accounts. Click your account name to jump straight to the password screen. Your last-played character will be noted beside your name for reference.

- **+ Add account** — adds a new account to the list
- **⚙ Settings** — opens the settings screen (see [Settings](#settings))

---

## The game window

Once you are in the game, the window is divided into two areas:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┬──────────────────┐
│                                     │  Room            │
│         Main game output            │  Vitals          │
│         (scrolling text)            │  Experience      │
│                                     │  Active Spells   │
├─────────────────────────────────────┴──────────────────┤
│ > command input                                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Status bar: connection · Lich · hands · Settings        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Left / main area** — This is the scrolling game output. Everything the game sends — room descriptions, combat, conversations, system messages — appears here.

**Right sidebar** — Info panels that update automatically as you play (see [Panels](#panels)).

**Command bar** — Type commands here and press **Enter** to send them.

**Status bar** — Shows whether you are connected, your Lich status, what is in your hands, and quick buttons for Settings and Highlights.

---

## Panels

The right sidebar contains collapsible panels that track different types of game information.

### Turning panels on or off

Click the **⊞ Panels** button at the top of the sidebar to open the panel manager. Check or uncheck any panel to show or hide it. Your choices are remembered between sessions.

### Resizing panels

Drag the thin resize handle at the bottom of any panel to make it taller or shorter.

### Collapsing panels

Click the **▾** button in a panel's title bar (or double-click the title bar) to collapse it. Click again to expand.

### Closing a panel

Click the **×** in the panel's title bar. You can re-add it any time via **⊞ Panels**.

---

### Room

Shows your current location: the room name, description, and clickable exits. Click any exit direction (e.g. **north**, **southwest**) to move that way automatically.

---

### Vitals

Shows your four core stats as percentage bars:

| Label | Stat      |
|-------|-----------|
| HP    | Health    |
| MP    | Mana / Concentration |
| SP    | Stamina   |
| ST    | Spirit    |

Below the bars:

- **ENC** — Your current encumbrance level (e.g. *None*, *Light Burden*, *Heavy Burden*). Type `enc` in the command bar to refresh it.
- **RT** badge — Appears when you are in roundtime, counting down in seconds.
- **Indicator badges** — Game status flags (bleeding, stunned, prone, etc.) appear as small labels when active.

---

### Experience

Shows the skills you have recently practiced, along with their rank and learning percentage. Type `exp` in the command bar to load or refresh the list.

Columns: **Skill name** | **Rank** | **% toward next rank** | **Mind state** (e.g. *Perusing*, *Dabbling*, *Attentive*)

---

### Active Spells

Shows the name of the spell you currently have active (if any).

---

### Combat

A scrolling log of recent combat messages — attacks, blocks, critical hits, etc. — separated from the main output so you can review combat history without scrolling up through unrelated text.

---

### Atmosphere

A scrolling log of atmospheric messages — ambient events, weather, NPC movements. Useful for roleplaying or spotting rare events without them being buried in combat text.

---

### Conversation

A scrolling log of speech, whispers, and thoughts (telepathy). All spoken text, party chat, and `thinkto` messages appear here so you can follow conversations even during busy combat.

---

### Inventory

Shows the contents of your inventory. Type `inv` in the command bar to load or refresh it.

---

## Command input

The command bar at the bottom of the screen works like any other DragonRealms client:

- Type a command and press **Enter** to send it.
- Press **↑ Arrow Up** to recall previous commands (command history, up to 100 entries).
- Press **↓ Arrow Down** to move forward through history.

The **R:** and **L:** display in the status bar shows what you are holding in each hand, updated automatically as you pick things up or put them down.

---

## Highlights

Highlights let you color-code text in the main output window. For example, you could highlight your character's name in gold, or make healing messages appear in green.

Open the Highlights editor by clicking **✦ Highlights** in the status bar.

### Adding a highlight

1. Click **+ Add highlight**.
2. Type the word or phrase you want to highlight in the **pattern** field.
3. Click a color swatch to set the text color.
4. Click **Save** (or your changes save automatically as you type).

### Options

Expand a highlight row by clicking **▼** to access extra options:

- **Regular expression** — Use a regex pattern instead of plain text (for advanced users).
- **Bold** — Make matched text bold.
- **Text color** — The color applied to the matched text.
- **Background** — A background color behind the matched text.

### Enabling / disabling

Use the checkbox on the left of each highlight row to turn it on or off without deleting it.

### Deleting a highlight

Click the **×** on the right side of the row.

---

## Settings

Click **⚙ Settings** in the status bar to open the settings dialog.

### Theme

Choose from several color themes for the game window. Themes change the background color, text colors, accent colors, and how vitals bars look. The preview shows a sample of each theme's colors. Click a theme to select it — it applies immediately.

### Display

- **Font family** — Choose the font used in the main output: Cascadia Code, Fira Code, Consolas, Courier New, or a generic monospace font.
- **Font size** — Drag the slider to adjust the text size (10–18 px).

### Lich

If you use Lich for scripting, set the path to your `lich.rbw` file here (see [Lich scripting](#lich-scripting)). Leave this blank if Meridian detects Lich automatically.

Click **Save** to apply changes.

---

## Lich scripting

[Lich](https://lichproject.org/) is a third-party Ruby scripting engine for GemStone and DragonRealms. Meridian can launch Lich for you after you connect, so your scripts run alongside the game.

### Setup

1. Install Ruby and Lich5 on your computer by following the instructions at the Lich Project website.
2. Open Meridian's **⚙ Settings** and set the **Lich path** to the full path of your `lich.rbw` file (e.g. `C:\Ruby4Lich5\Lich5\lich.rbw`). If you installed Lich in the default location, Meridian may detect it automatically.

### Using Lich

Once you are connected to the game, the status bar shows a Lich indicator:

- **○ Start Lich** — Lich is not running. Click to launch it.
- **◌ Lich starting…** — Lich is connecting.
- **● Lich active** — Lich is running. Your scripts are available.
- **✕ Retry Lich** — Something went wrong. Click to try again.

Click **▸ log** / **▾ log** to show or hide Lich's startup log, useful for diagnosing problems.

If you do not use Lich, you can ignore this indicator entirely. Meridian works fine as a standalone client without it.

## Troubleshooting

**Windows shows a virus / SmartScreen warning when I try to install.**
This is expected for unsigned applications. Click **More info**, then **Run anyway**. The installer is safe.

**The vitals bars show 0% or the wrong values.**
Vitals update automatically as the game sends data. If they look wrong right after connecting, type any command (e.g. `health`) to prompt the server to send a fresh update.

**ENC always shows "None" even when I am burdened.**
The server only sends encumbrance text when you type the `enc` command. Type `enc` to refresh it. It does not update automatically when you pick up or drop items.

**Experience panel is empty.**
Type `exp` in the command bar. The server only sends experience data when you ask for it.

**Inventory panel is empty.**
Type `inv` in the command bar.

**I cannot see the DevTools / the app seems stuck.**
Press **F12** to open the developer tools window, which may show error messages useful for troubleshooting.

**Lich fails to start.**
- Confirm the path to `lich.rbw` is correct in **⚙ Settings**.
- Make sure Ruby is installed and working on your computer.
- Click **▸ log** in the status bar to read Lich's startup output for error details.

**I need to log in with a different account.**
From the Welcome back screen, click **+ Add account**. To remove a saved account, there is currently no in-app delete button — this will be added in a future update.
